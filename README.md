I'm Amanda, a data scientist, nice to have you on my page. This is where I add some of my writing and code creations. 
If I were to describe myself in a structured way, it would probably resemble something like the dictionary below:

```python
amanda = {
    "programming": [
    	"python",
	"R", 
	"elixir"
    ],
    "things that energize me": [
        "coding",
        "coffee",
	"languages", 
	"gardening", 
	"music",
	"cooking",
        "running"
    ],
    "causes": [
	"data science for social good", 
	"women in data science"
    ],
    "current interested in": [
	"NLP", 
	"information retrieval",
	"RAG",
	"MLOps"
    ]
}
```

👩‍💻
Coding is fun because I love logical challenges. Also because it beautifully (and modestly) connects living beings with technology, often aimed at enhancing their lives. The modest aspect comes from the fact that many people are unaware of the code's existence, working quietly behind the scenes to provide assistance. I believe my definition of success is similar to it - I like to know I helped people become better, regardless of whether it brings me fame or recognition.

☕
Coffee is not only one of the coziest moments of my day, it is also an art when you learn to appreciate the making of it. Caffeine in moderation is good for the beginning of ones' day. As a hot drink, coffee brings warmth as you sip and your body tries to achieve a thermal equilibrium.

🗨️
Languages are a cognitive challenge and help to understand the diversity of beliefs and behaviours as you dive into a culture. I have already studied almost a dozen of them. Even better when linguistics and computer science meet: natural language processing!

🪴
Gardening is a getaway to nature and to slowing down, as a byproduct one can have organic food collected. 

🎵
Music is related to the feeling of spark, and I love how it makes me more inspired and concentrated during almost all activities.

🧑‍🍳
Cooking healthy and tasty food is good for the body and the mind; I love to explore ingredients and to feel I am capable of reproducing recipes or creating new ones.

🏃‍♀️
Running, according to neuroscientists, is the best physical exercise for long term cardiovascular and mental healths. I am learning to appreciate the effort of it.


Look forward to discussing any of the topics above with a cup of coffee!
