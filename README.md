Nice to have you on my Github page. 

My name is Amanda, I am a data scientist. You can find some of the things I write and create on the blog page. 
If my data could be structured, my current version would be something close to the dictionary below:

```python
amanda = {
    "programming": [
    	"python",
	"R", 
	"elixir"
    ],
    "interests": [
        "coding",
        "coffee",
	"languages", 
	"gardening", 
	"music",
	"cooking",
        "running"
    ],
    "causes": [
	"data science for social good", 
	"women in data science"
    ]
}
```

👩‍💻
Coding is fun because I love logical challenges; but also because it beautifully (and modestly) connects living beings to technologies that mostly want to help them. Modestly is due to the fact that most people don't even know the code exists and is behind the scenes to help. I believe my definition of success is similar to it - I like to know I helped people become better, without necessarily being famous, known or recognized for it. 

☕
Coffee is not only one of the coziest moments of my day, it is also an art when you learn to appreciate it better. Caffeine in moderation is good for the beginning of ones' day. As a hot drink, coffee brings warmth as you sip and your body tries to achieve a thermal equilibrium.

🗨️
Languages are a cognitive challenge and help to understand the diversity of beliefs and behaviours as you dive into a culture. I have already studied almost a dozen of them. 

🪴
Gardening is a getaway to nature and to slowing down, as a byproduct one can have organic food collected. 

🎵
Music is connected to happiness, and I love how it makes me more inspired and concentrated during almost all activities.

🧑‍🍳
Cooking healthy and tasty food is good for the body and the mind; I love to explore ingredients and to feel I am capable of reproducing recipes or creating new ones.

🏃‍♀️
Running, according to neuroscientists, is the best physical exercise for long term cardiovascular and mental healths. I am learning to appreciate the effort of it.


Look forward to discussing any of the topics above with a cup of coffee!
